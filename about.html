            <p>
                I am a Machine Learning Engineer, a math major, and a dyslexic.
                I have been writing code for a really long time now (on and off).
                I initially started with MATLAB and C++, using them to explore 
                mathematical concepts in numerical analysis and optimizations, 
                playfully plotting fractals like the Julia and Mandelbrot sets and 
                as writing code for some commonly used mathematical methods and 
                algorithms to aid in my coursework. At some point, I write some 
                complicated MATLAB code to perform gaussian elimination, 
                finite difference method, simpson's 1/3 and 3/8 rules of
                numerical integration and a partial implementation of the 
                simplex method, among others.
                <br><br>
                Then I learnt python everything changed. I writing code to solve
                problems grounded in the real world and levearaging AI.
                I tried a lot of things, some worked,
                others didn't. Here are some of them: a custom resume generator 
                levearaging LLMs to generate tailored resumes based on job descriptions
                , an app that help's its users improve mental math calculcations, 
                a simple web app that extracts useful insights from whatsapp 
                conversations, an RL agent to play chess using LLM (didnt work),
                an RL agent to play snake and breakout.
                <br><br>
                Beyond software and AI, I like to go back to my roots in
                math and solve some basic problems, explore some popular 
                problems and read interesting materials on diverse math topics.
                I have great interest in complex analysis as well as abstract
                algebra. I also enjoy reading on theoritical computer science
                and number theory. While I have a keen interest in resaerch, 
                the right path to take remains a blur to me.
                <br><br>
                In my leisure time, I play chess, contribute on wikipedia, 
                try to solve problems on codewars in C++ and python without using external 
                libaries, play video games(mainly football manager),
                and support Manchester United.
