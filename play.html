            </h3>
            <p>
                Chess has been an absorbing hobby of mine since 2021, ignited by countless evenings of friendly matches with my friend. 
                Our matches, typically lasting from 4 pm to 10 pm, were characterized by amateur moves, often leaving queens, rooks, and even 
                kings vulnerable for several turns.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you share the same passion for chess, I invite you to join me on 
                <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/so-dipe" target="_blank">Chess.com</a>. With a current 
                ranking in the top 10% worldwide on the platform, I'm always eager to engage in stimulating matches 
                with fellow enthusiasts. Feel free to challenge me; let's enjoy the thrill of this ancient game together.

            <p>
                Delving into the realm of Wikipedia, my initial goal was to create articles in the fields of mathematics and technology. 
                However, I found myself initially occupied with minor yet impactful tasks, primarily centered around providing crucial citations. 
                This process quickly became an engaging pursuit for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite the seemingly modest nature of my contributions, I derive immense satisfaction from making subtle adjustments 
                that often go unnoticed, yet serve to assist a select group of readers. It's the joy of these quiet, meaningful impacts 
                that drives my dedication to the platform.

            </h3>
            <p>
                When it comes to movies, I'm really picky. I'd rather watch a movie/shows I've seen a billion times than start a new one. 
                My most liked movies in no particular order would be Fight Club, The Dark Knight, and The Matrix.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Dark Knight made me want to see all Christopher Nolan movies. 
                I have seen a handful but keep procrastinating seeing the others. I enjoy watching Al Pacino perform, as well as Keanu Reeves.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to TV shows, I prefer the 10-season sitcoms. I've seen Modern Family, 
                Seinfeld, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and Brooklyn 99 all more than once.
            </p>

                Mary introduced me to the world of Nigerian movies, and I've been enjoying 
                watching these local productions. She made a list which you can find here:

            <p>
                According to my friends, my taste in music is quite unique. Billie Eilish has effortlessly captured my heart, 
                leading me to listen to her entire discography up to five times this year (which, in my opinion, isn't excessive). 
                Tracks like "TV," "All the good girls go to hell," and "Billie Bossa Nova" have become staples in my daily playlist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also hold a special place for Eminem, often finding his song "Mockingbird" frequently recommended in my daily 
                Spotify mixes. My musical preferences further extend to include artists such as Melanie Martinez, Rihanna, Bruno Mars, 
                and a diverse range of musicians.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exploring local talents, I find myself drawn to the sounds of Asake and Mohbad (may his soul rest in peace), 
                while my musical interests don't particularly align with artists like Davido and Wizkid, nor do I find myself engaged 
                in conversations centered around them.
            </p>
            <p>
                To delve deeper into my musical inclinations, I have compiled a variety of playlists featuring my most-played tracks. 
                Feel free to explore my musical world on

            <p>
                Although I enjoy watching football a lot, you won't catch me playing it. I'm a passionate Manchester United fan 
                and try to catch as many of their games as possible. My interest extends to watching YouTube videos, particularly 
                those focusing on football, especially Manchester United. I'm particularly drawn to tactical analysis videos and 
                enjoy revisiting game highlights. My football watching is primarily centered around Manchester United, and I 
                don't follow other football leagues closely.

                I've had the pleasure of playing a diverse array of games and have many more on my list. Among my favorites are the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series. I've also played and enjoyed every version of Pro Evolution Soccer from 2013 to 2021 and EA Sport's FIFA from 14 to 23.
        
                Additionally, I've completed Grand Theft Auto IV and V, as well as Need For Speed from both 2005 and 2012.

                But my favorite and most played games end up being building games like Cities Skylines and Sim City.

                Football Manager is my favorite game. I have played every version from 2016 to 2023. In 2017, 
                I won the Champions League with Rangers F.C. and RB Leipzig.
        
                Usually, I play as the manager of Manchester United and focus on developing young players. 
                Recently, I achieved went unbeaten for 2 seasons in a row with O.G.C. Nice and Paris Saint Germain, securing the treble both times.
