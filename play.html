            <p>
                Chess has been an absorbing hobby of mine since 2021, ignited by countless evenings of friendly matches with my friend. 
                Our matches, typically lasting from 4 pm to 10 pm, were characterized by amateur moves, often leaving queens, rooks hanging, blundering
                mate in 1 and 2. Sometimes even moving other pieces while the king is in check.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have since improved and I'm currently ranked in the 90th percentile of players on <strong><i>Chess.com</i></strong>. 
                If you share the same passion for chess and would like to challenge me to a friendly game (rated or unrated), feel free 
                to send a challenge my way here

                I initially ventured into Wikipedia with the intention of composing articles related to mathematics and technology. 
                However, I started by undertaking minor tasks, primarily focusing on providing citations. Surprisingly, I found this 
                process engaging and fulfilling. Most of my contributions involve making subtle yet impactful alterations that often 
                go unnoticed, yet serve to assist a few individuals. I have developed a genuine passion for this form of contribution, 
                thoroughly enjoying the experience.

            <p>
                When it comes to movies, I'm the definition of selective. I tend to find comfort in revisiting 
                my all-time favorites repeatedly rather than taking a chance on something new. Among my most 
                cherished films, Fight Club, The Dark Knight, and The Matrix hold special places in my heart, 
                each for their own unique reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Dark Knight was a game-changer for me; it sparked an unyielding desire to explore the entirety 
                of Christopher Nolan's cinematic universe. While I've managed to catch a few of his masterpieces, 
                I'll admit that I've been procrastinating on experiencing the rest, and that's a secret I'm still working on.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the world of acting, I find myself drawn to the compelling performances of legends like Al Pacino, 
                as well as the subtle intensity brought to the screen by the one and only Keanu Reeves.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to TV shows, I have a soft spot for the timeless charm of 10-season sitcoms. 
                Modern Family, Seinfeld, Friends, The Big Bang Theory, and Brooklyn 99 have all graced my screen 
                more than once, providing endless laughter and comfort during my downtime.

                On a delightful note, my friend Mary recently introduced me to the captivating world of Nigerian 
                movies, and I must admit, I've developed quite a taste for these vibrant and unique productions. 
                In fact, I hosted a list of her top picks on notion, which you can explore here

            <p>
                When it comes to music, my friends often tease me about my 'unique' taste, but hey, I proudly wear my 'weird' 
                music badge! Billie Eilish holds a special place in my heart, and I may or may not have immersed myself in her 
                entire discography a solid five times this year (I promise, that's not excessive). Tracks like TV, All the good girls 
                go to hell, and Billie Bossa Nova have effortlessly become the soundtrack of my days, playing on an infinite loop.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the realm of rap, Eminem's timeless hits, with Mockingbird being a constant presence in my daily Spotify mix, 
                never fail to strike a chord. Melanie Martinez, Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, The Weeknd, and Bruno Mars are 
                just a few more gems in my diverse music collection, each adding their unique flavor to my playlist rotation.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for local talents, Asake and the late Mohbad (may he rest in peace) have captivated my ears 
                with their distinct sounds, providing a refreshing perspective in the music scene. While my 
                preference doesn't necessarily lean towards the more mainstream artists like Davido and Wizkid, 
                I find myself drawn to the unique beats and rhythms of artists that are a little less in the spotlight.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're curious to dive deeper into my music world, feel free to check out my Spotify playlists, 
                where you'll find a curated collection of my most cherished tracks. You can find me on

                Although I enjoy watching football a lot, you won't catch me playing it. I'm a passionate Manchester United fan 
                and try to catch as many of their games as possible. My interest extends to watching YouTube videos, particularly 
                those focusing on football, especially Manchester United. I'm particularly drawn to tactical analysis videos and 
                enjoy revisiting game highlights. My football watching is primarily centered around Manchester United, and I 
                don't follow other football teams or leagues closely.

                I've had the pleasure of playing a diverse array of games and have many more on my list. Among my favorites are the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series. I've also played and enjoyed every version of Pro Evolution Soccer from 2013 to 2021 and EA Sport's FIFA from 14 to 23.
        
                Additionally, I've completed Grand Theft Auto IV and V, as well as Need For Speed from both 2005 and 2012.

                But my favorite and most played games end up being building games like Cities Skylines and Sim City.

                Football Manager is my favorite game. I have played every version from 2016 to 2023. In 2017, 
                I won the Champions League with Rangers F.C. and RB Leipzig.
        
                Usually, I play as the manager of Manchester United and focus on developing young players. 
                Recently, I achieved went unbeaten for 2 seasons in a row with O.G.C. Nice and Paris Saint Germain, securing the treble both times.
